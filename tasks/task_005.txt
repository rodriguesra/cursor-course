# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement text streaming functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add real-time streaming of AI responses as they're generated to enhance user experience.
# Details:
Modify the OpenAI API integration to use streaming mode. Implement server-side handling of the stream using NextJS server components. Create a client-side component that can render the incoming tokens in real-time. Use React state to update the UI as new tokens arrive. Ensure proper error handling for stream interruptions. Follow the OpenAI_StreamText.md documentation for implementation details.

# Test Strategy:
Test streaming by sending messages and verifying that responses appear incrementally. Measure response time to ensure real-time feedback. Test error recovery when streams are interrupted.
