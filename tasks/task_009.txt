# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement New Chat functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Add the ability to start a fresh conversation while storing the previous chat.
# Details:
Create a "New Chat" button in the UI. Implement logic to save the current chat session to Supabase when starting a new chat. Generate a title for the chat session based on the first message. Clear the current conversation state and reset the interface when starting a new chat. Update the database schema to track the active chat session.

# Test Strategy:
Test creating new chats and verify that previous conversations are properly stored. Validate that the chat interface is reset correctly. Check that chat titles are generated and stored appropriately.
