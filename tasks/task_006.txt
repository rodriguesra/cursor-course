# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate the chat interface with Supabase to store and retrieve chat messages and sessions.
# Details:
Create Supabase Edge Functions to handle chat logic and API interactions. Implement functions to save new messages to the database as they are sent and received. Set up queries to retrieve message history for a given chat session. Ensure proper error handling for database operations. Update the UI to display messages from the database when loading a chat session.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that messages are correctly stored in the database after being sent. Test retrieval of message history for different chat sessions. Validate that the correct chat_id is associated with each message.
