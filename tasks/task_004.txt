# Task ID: 4
# Title: Integrate OpenAI API for text generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the connection to OpenAI's API for text generation using the GPT-4.1-nano model.
# Details:
Create a service module to handle communication with OpenAI's API. Implement functions to send user messages to the GPT-4.1-nano model and receive responses. Set up proper error handling for API failures and rate limiting. Configure the API with appropriate parameters for the chat completion endpoint. Create a server-side route handler in NextJS to proxy requests to OpenAI for security.

# Test Strategy:
Test API integration by sending sample messages and verifying responses. Validate error handling by simulating API failures. Check that the correct model (gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14) is being used.
