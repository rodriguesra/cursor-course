# Description: Create the UI components for the chat interface including message display area, input field, and send button.
# Details:
Design and implement React components for the chat interface using TailwindCSS and ShadUI. Create a message container to display the conversation history with clear visual distinction between user and AI messages. Implement an input area with text field and send button. Add basic state management for messages using React hooks. Ensure the layout is responsive and follows the clean, minimal design described in the PRD.
