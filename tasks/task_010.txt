# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Enhance the application with proper error handling, loading indicators, and final UI refinements.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling for API failures, network issues, and other potential errors. Add loading indicators for message sending, image generation, and other asynchronous operations. Refine the UI with improved styling, animations, and responsiveness. Optimize performance by implementing proper React rendering strategies. Ensure cross-browser compatibility and test on different devices.

# Test Strategy:
Test error scenarios by simulating API failures and network issues. Verify that loading indicators appear at appropriate times. Conduct usability testing to ensure the UI is intuitive and responsive across different browsers and devices.
