# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Supabase local instance and database schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a local Supabase instance and create the database schema for storing chat sessions and messages.
# Details:
Install Supabase CLI and initialize a local Supabase instance. Create SQL migrations for the Chat Session and Chat Message tables according to the data models specified in the PRD. The Chat Session table should include id, created_at, updated_at, and title fields. The Chat Message table should include id, created_at, chat_id, role, content, type, and optional image_url fields. Set up foreign key relationships between tables. Configure Supabase client in the NextJS application.

# Test Strategy:
Run migrations and verify that tables are created correctly. Test CRUD operations on both tables to ensure the schema works as expected. Validate foreign key constraints.
